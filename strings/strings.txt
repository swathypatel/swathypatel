mutable vs immutable:
    In immutable, modification of string creates a copy while in mutable, modification is done inplace.
    Some languages support mutable strings as well. Stringbuilder is example of mutable string.

Kadane's Algorithm: Maximum subarray sum.
    eg: [1, -3, 2, 1, -1]

    Brute force solution:
        - for 1st element, add first 2 elements, first 3 elements, first 4 elements etc.
        - for 2nd element, add second third, second third fourth so on elements.
        Get the maximum out of all elements. Order is O(n ^ 2)


    Kadane's solution:
        intuition:
            For example, for 3rd index, max subarray is max(3rd index , 0 - 2nd max + 3rd index)
                     lly, for 4th index, max subarray is max(4th index, 0-3rd max + 4th index)

        Solution:
            - initialize 0th index to local_max and global_max.
            - local_max(3rd index, 0-2 max + 3rd index)
            - global_max = max(global_max, local_max)
