# For a given node, find the successor(value next to node) and predecessor(value previous to node).
# eg: for node with value 4 , successor is 5 and predecessor is 3.

        #     5
        #    / \
        #   3   6
        #  / \
        #  2  4
        #  /
        # 1


# Solution 1 :
#        Do inorder traversal and append to the list. list is by default sorted. for a number get next element, that is the successor.
#
# Solution 2:
#        Do BST and get all the elements. sort them and then get the next to the element, that is the successor.


# Solution 3:
# If root node is the p, then its successor will always be in right side.
# if p is left most child, then its successor is it parent.
# if p is the right most child, then there is no successor.
# if p is in between, there are cases.
