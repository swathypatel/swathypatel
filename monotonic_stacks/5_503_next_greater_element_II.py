# 503. Next Greater Element II
#
# Given a circular integer array nums (i.e., the next element of nums[nums.length - 1] is nums[0]),
# return the next greater number for every element in nums.
#
# The next greater number of a number x is the first greater number to its traversing-order next in the array,
# which means you could search circularly to find its next greater number. If it doesn't exist, return -1 for this number.
#
#
# Input: nums = [1,2,1]
# Output: [2,-1,2]
# Explanation: The first 1's next greater number is 2;
# The number 2 can't find next greater number.
# The second 1's next greater number needs to search circularly, which is also 2.
#
# Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,3]
# Output: [2,3,4,-1,4]
